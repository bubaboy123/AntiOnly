# AntiOnly

Play as Anti Form the whole time. (Except Pride Lands and Atlantica) To allow the game to be beaten you will not have the increased damage Anti Form takes and you will be able to use items and magic.

Currently you crash if you change Soras Primary Keyblade. (Don't do that unless in Pride Lands or Atlantica where you are not Anti Form Sora. A forced menu also lets you change it.)

You must either start a New Game or load a save where you have obtained all forms to prevent crashing due to forms missing Keyblades.

To make the game beatable the game thinks you are Master Form. So your magic if you want to use it will be master magic, you can use items, and you can use aerial dodge. You also get stats from both Base Soras Keyblade and Masters Keyblade I think and also the crash that Keyblade switching crash exists on this like it does on all forms with two Keyblades since the game thinks you are master form.
