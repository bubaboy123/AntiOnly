# AntiOnly

Play as Anti Form the whole time. (Except Pride Lands and Atlantica) To allow the game to be beaten you will not have the increased damage Anti Form takes and you will be able to use items and magic.

Currently you crash if you change Soras Primary Keyblade. (Don't do that unless in Pride Lands or Atlantica where you are not Anti Form Sora. A forced menu also lets you change it.)

You must either start a New Game or load a save where you have obtained all forms to prevent crashing due to forms missing Keyblades.

To make the game beatable the game thinks you are Valor Form. you can use magic and items. You also get stats from both Base Soras Keyblade and Valors Keyblade and also the crash that Keyblade switching crash exists on this like it does on all forms with two Keyblades since the game thinks you are Valor Form.

You have Max Level growth of other forms if starting a new game except dodge roll. If you do not want to have this open the mod.yml in a text editor and scroll down to the bottom where it says `#Delete everything below if you dont want growth from other forms` and delete everything below this line before starting a new game.
